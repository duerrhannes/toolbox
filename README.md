This is a collection of tools and jupyter-notebooks to streamline your workflow and ease your day. Feel free to try them out and optimize them.

Contents:
- [heic-converter](heic-converter): simple tool to convert .heic images (mostly used by Apple) into .jpeg format.
- [remove-duplicates](remove-duplicates): check a source directory for duplicates of files which exist already in a target directory (and subdirs) and deletes the duplicates from the source directory. Possibility to detect duplicates only by file name or by file hash (so you can still find duplicates with different names). Possibility to only filter for certain file types.
